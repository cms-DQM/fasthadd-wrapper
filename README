This package just adds `fastHadd` program to the path. The program 
itself has to installed from CMSDIST: 
https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/blob/IB/CMSSW_11_3_X/master/fasthadd.spec 
(backport clanup changes from cc8 branch). We need two script files and 
a spec.

These scripts that will be installed into the target machines. They find 
the tool that is being installed.

Files:
fastHadd
fasthadd.spec
fasthadd-wrapper.spec
build.sh
README

Bump the version up each time! Change the location of files created above.
